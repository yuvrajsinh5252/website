## Problem Overview

In this challenge, we analyze reactor safety reports. Each report is a sequence of levels, and a report is considered "safe" if:
- The levels are either all increasing or all decreasing
- Adjacent levels differ by at least 1 and at most 3

Our task is to count how many reports are safe.

## Part 1: Basic Safety Check

Looking at this problem, I need to determine if each sequence follows a consistent pattern. The tricky part is that I don't know upfront whether a sequence should be increasing or decreasing - I have to figure that out as I go.

My approach is to track both possibilities until I see the first difference between consecutive numbers. Once I know the direction, any violation of that pattern or any jump outside the 1-3 range means the report is unsafe. Single-element reports are an interesting edge case - they're technically safe since they don't violate any rules!

<TabbedCodeBlock
  tabs={[
    {
      language: "cpp",
      code: `#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ifstream file("input.txt");
  string line;
  int safe = 0;

  while (getline(file, line)) {
    stringstream ss(line);

    int num, prev = -1, inc = -1, dec = -1;
    bool increasing = true, decreasing = true, is_safe = true;

    while (ss >> num) {
      if (prev == -1) prev = num;
      else {
        if (inc == -1 && dec == -1) {
          if (num > prev) inc = 1;
          else if (num < prev) dec = 1;
        }

        if (inc == 1 && num <= prev) increasing = false;
        if (dec == 1 && num >= prev) decreasing = false;
        if (abs(num - prev) < 1 || abs(num - prev) > 3) is_safe = false;
        prev = num;
      }
    }

    if (increasing && decreasing && is_safe) safe++;
  }

  cout << safe << endl;
}`
    }
  ]}

## Part 2: Problem Dampener

Part 2 introduces the Problem Dampener - we can now tolerate one bad reading by removing it. This changes the game completely. Instead of immediately rejecting an unsafe report, I need to check if removing any single element would make it safe.

The strategy is straightforward but thorough: first check if the report is already safe (no need to remove anything), and if not, try removing each element one by one until I find a configuration that works. It's like having a second chance when something goes wrong!

<TabbedCodeBlock
  tabs={[
    {
      language: "cpp",
      code: `#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

bool check_safety(vector<int> level, int avoid) {
  int prev = -1, inc = -1, dec = -1;
  bool increasing = true, decreasing = true, is_safe = true;

  for (int i = 0; i < level.size(); ++i) {
    if (i == avoid) continue;

    if (prev == -1) prev = level[i];
    else {
      if (inc == -1 && dec == -1) {
        if (level[i] > prev) inc = 1;
        else if (level[i] < prev) dec = 1;
      }

      if (inc == 1 && level[i] <= prev) increasing = false;
      if (dec == 1 && level[i] >= prev) decreasing = false;
      if (abs(level[i] - prev) < 1 || abs(level[i] - prev) > 3) is_safe = false;
      prev = level[i];
    }
  }

  if (increasing && decreasing && is_safe) return true;
  return false;
}

int main() {
  ifstream file("input.txt");
  string line;
  int safe = 0;
  vector<vector<int>> reports;

  while (getline(file, line)) {
    stringstream ss(line);
    vector<int> levels;
    int num;

    while (ss >> num) levels.push_back(num);
    reports.push_back(levels);
  }

  for (auto report : reports) {
    if (check_safety(report, -1)) safe++;
    else {
      for (int i = 0; i < report.size(); ++i) {
        if (check_safety(report, i)) {
          safe++;
          break;
        }
      }
    }
  }

  cout << safe << endl;
}`
    }
  ]}

*Turns out the Problem Dampener is just "try turning it off and on again" but for data points. Works every time!*
